- From a terminal go to the `docker/` directory under this project.
- Run `docker build --force-rm --tag options-sender:1.0.0 .`
  - Ensure the tag name unique.
- Push the image into your docker repository.

### Deployment into kubernetes
- Make sure you have a working k8s cluster.
- Make sure your k8s cluster has access to your docker repository.
  - If not, ensure you push the image into the docker repository used by your k8s cluster. For e.g. on minikube, you can use `minikube image load options-sender:1.0.0`.

- Kubernetes deployment manifest files are available under the directory `k8s/`.
- The application gets deployed as a Service with one pod behind it.
- Run - `kubectl apply -f ./options-responder.yaml` to deploy the SIP server into your k8s cluster.
